Software architecture tools that simplify changing code that "wasn't designed to do that"

##Short overview of architecture and definition of terms

We consider architecture to consist of three high level areas:
	1. Components: The basic building blocks, usually individual classes/interfaces
	2. Composition: How components are used together and how they are created/destroyed
	3. Organization: How you find your components, this is almost always a file system explorer like solution explorer in Visual Studio
